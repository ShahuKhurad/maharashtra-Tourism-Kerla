              <b> Kozhikode: </b> The ports of the Malabar Coast have participated in the Indian Ocean trade in spices, silk, and other goods for over two millennia. There are documented visits, as early as the 14th century, by Chinese travellers such as Zheng He.

                Zheng He's navigation chart from Hormuz to Calicut, 1430During the Sangam period, Calicut District formed part of the Chera Empire. It played an important role in fostering trade relations between Kerala and the outside world. Tondi, present day Kadalundi, as per scholars, was a flourishing seaport of Kerala at that time. Very little is known about Calicut's history in the post-Sangam age (which is considered to be a Dark Age in South India's history). During the 9th century, Calicut became a part of the Second Chera Empire. The Cheras (also known as Perumals) ruled the territory until 1122 AD. After the fall of the Cheras, the Chera kingdom in Kerala was divided into many independent districts called "Nadus", such as Eranad (land of the Eradis) and Polanad. The Porlarthris, rulers of Polanad, controlled the area to be later called as kozhikode. <br><br>
                <br><br>
                During the 13th century AD, the Udaiyavar of Ernad, whose headquarters was at Nediyiruppu wanted an outlet to the sea. After going to war with the Polatthiri King for 48 long years he conquered the area around Ponniankara (Panniyankara) and build a fort at a place called Velapuram. Thus the city of Calicut came into existence sometime in the 13th century AD. With the conquest of Calicut, the status of the Udaiyavar increased and he came to be known as Swami Nambiyathiri Thirumulpad. This title gradually shortened to Samoothirippadu or Saamoothiri or Samuri over the years. The Europeans called him Zamorin.
                <br><br>
                Vasco da Gama delivers the letter of King Manuel I of Portugal to the Zamorin of CalicutIn 1498 Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Kappad, about 25 km from Calicut city. This was a major event in the era of European exploration because the discovery of the sea route from Europe to India gave the Portuguese a significant advantage in the control of international trade. Portuguese control of the sea route lasted for almost a century.
