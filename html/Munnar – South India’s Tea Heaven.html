				Munnar is a quaint town and an idyllic hill station located in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Set at an altitude of 6000 ft in the district of Idukki, Munnar used to be the summer resort of the British rulers during colonial times. It is known for its green belt of lush forests and unending expanse of tea estates and is also home to some of the endangered species of animals like Neelakurinji and Nilgiri Tahr. It is known to be one of the most sought after tourist destinations in South India due to its pristine valleys, mountains, and exotic varieties of flora and fauna.  <br><br>

Munnar is a spectacular spot in Kerala, and its beauty attracts thousands of visitors every year towards it. What makes Munnar even more popular is the presence of three rivers that flow through this area, namely Mattupetti, Periavaru, and Nallathanni. Various viewpoints are segregated throughout this area, from where you can have a look at the stunning valleys, hills, and rivers. It’s pleasant hills, pristine lakes, and rocky terrains have further made it a popular trekking and camping site. 
<br><br>
